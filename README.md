# RainbowTable

A brute forced method to crack passwords using the rainbow table algorithm.

## How to use it

To test the algorithm, just execute the command below on a terminal.

`python MainTest.py -n 100`

This will run 100 attempts to crack passwords with length equals to 3.

You can change the `-p`, `-c` or the `-r` option in order to set the password length,
the number of chains and the number of rows in the rainbow table respectively.
